                        Accidents will always be a part of life, but that doesn’t mean that your accident is acceptable. Many accidents can be prevented, and you deserve to receive justice and financial compensation when someone else caused you harm.

                        Unfortunately, you are likely dealing with physical injuries, mental trauma caused by your accident, and a host of other losses. Maybe you don’t have the strength to handle a personal injury or workers compensation claim on your own. No matter what brought
                        about your accident, if negligence was involved, you can seek damages from the party who harmed you.

                            One of the qualities you want your attorney to possess is compassion. You need someone who understands the difficulties you’re facing and who will treat you as a person, not as a case. You’ve been through something terrible, and you deserve respect and
                            consideration during this trying time.

                            Many attorneys will tell you that they are the right person for the job, but you will later find that they aren’t what you expected. You want an attorney who knows how to do the job right and who will behave in a professional manner—someone who takes
                            the time to prepare fully and will see that your claim is handled properly to the end.

                            They will start by investigating the accident that hurt you and finding out what caused it. They will then figure out who is liable for the injuries you’ve suffered and the losses that have been thrust upon you.

                    Injured at work? Let a workers compensation attorney in Hastings help you file your claim so you can focus on what really matters: <span>your health.</span>

                        When you’ve been injured at work, you might be eligible to file a workers compensation claim rather than a personal injury claim. Most employers in Nebraska are required to carry workers comp insurance to protect their employees financially when they’ve
                        been injured on the job.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        The good thing about workers compensation laws is that they protect workers regardless of who caused the accident. As long as your injury occurred at work, or because of your work duties, you might be owed benefits through workers comp.
                    </p>

                        A Hastings workers compensation lawyer at our firm can help you submit your claim, which will make a denial from the insurance company less likely. Insurance companies can make you jump through hoops in order to receive compensation. Having an attorney
                        on your side can make all the difference in receiving your benefits as quickly as possible.

                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Workers compensation often covers your lost wages, medical bills, and other expenses while you recover from a work-related injury.

                    The Settlement You Need for a Hastings Injury Accident
                </h2>
                <p>
                    You’ve come to our website seeking answers to your questions. One of the most vital questions an accident victim has: <span>“How much is my claim worth?”</span>
                </p>
                <p>
                    This question, of course, can’t be answered here, but you can get a sense of your claim’s value by understanding which damages you’ve experienced.
                </p>
                <div class="sattement-inner">
                    <div class="settlement-left">
                        <p>
                            For example, if you have sustained serious injuries in an accident, you likely have medical expenses you’ve been paying for yourself. When someone else caused your accident, these medical bills can be added to your claim.

                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can also add your lost wages to the pile. For example, if you’ve been out of work for six months, you can be compensated for all of the income you lost due to your injuries. In addition, if you’ve suffered a permanent injury, you might not be able
                            to work for weeks or months—maybe ever. You can be compensated for future lost income, as well.

                        </p>

                            One of the duties your Hastings personal injury and workers comp lawyers at our firm will take upon themselves is that of helping you calculate all of the losses your accident and injuries have brought to your life
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            You can be compensated for financial losses and non-financial losses. Non-financial losses are things such as the pain of your injuries, mental suffering, and loss of life enjoyment.

                        After a serious injury accident, you are probably not sure what comes next. Whether you were hurt in an auto wreck, a slip-and-fall accident, a work-related incident, or a motorcycle collision, you need to know that you have options.

                        Filing a claim is within your rights, but where do you start? Talking with a Hastings personal injury lawyer at our firm is the best first step. Our lawyers will be happy to answer your questions during a free, initial case analysis. To get you started,
                        here are some answers to commonly asked questions our attorneys receive:
                    </p>
                    <div class="qna">
                        <h4>
                            How long does Nebraska law give me to file a personal injury claim?
                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            In Nebraska, the time frame you have to submit a personal injury claim is four years. This is known as the statute of limitations. It’s important that you understand that once the four-year time frame has elapsed, you will no longer have the opportunity
                            to file a claim.
                        </p>

                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            <span> Comparative negligence</span> is when the fault of all parties involved in an accident is compared. Each person who was involved in the accident will be assigned a percentage of fault. So long as your fault was not greater
                            than the other involved party, you can still go after that person for damages, even if you were somewhat to blame for the accident.

                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            Workers compensation claims are filed with your employer’s work comp insurance company. You can receive benefits for an accident that occurred at work even if you caused the accident that hurt you. With a personal injury claim, you can only receive compensation
                            for an accident if you weren’t the one who caused it.

                        </h4>
                        <p>
                            Yes, there can be more than one person who is legally responsible for your damages. For example, if you’re in an accident caused by a commercial truck driver, both the trucker and the trucking company could be liable for your losses.

                        <p>
                            A contingency fee arrangement is when an attorney agrees to take your case on the condition that you will pay for their legal services after you win a settlement. The attorney’s fees are contingent—or dependent upon—the attorney getting you the settlement
                            you’re after.
